# Prerequisites
## Discord setup:
Go to https://discord.com/developers/applications and log in
Create an application 

Add redirects that match web endpoint for tgrgbace.  For example, if your tgrgbace
setup is at https://flinch.tgrgbace.tv, add a redirect for https://flinch.tgrgbace.tv/vouch/auth.  Save the OAuth2 secrets; you'll need these secrets for later.

More info at: https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/oauth2

## DNS Setup
You'll need to create a DNS record for your hostname (say tgrgbox.com)

## Master List of secrets and information
1. OAuth client id and secret id from your discord app
2. OvenMediaEngine signing key - a random string.  Try to avoid xml metacharacters for your own sanity
3. A list of discord user names that are allowed to access the platform
4. A list of discord user names that are allowed to access the streaming key


## Install prerequesites
### Install Docker
(Following directions from https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/)

Prereqs:

```sudo apt-get install ca-certificates curl gnupg lsb-release```

Install Key and source
 ```
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg

echo \
  "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
  $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null

```
  
Update apt and install docker
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-compose
```
 
 Add current user to docker group:
 
 ```sudo usermod -aG docker $USER```
 
Log out and back in again to pick up the new group

### Install npm
```
sudo apt install npm
```

### Install ansible ###
```
sudo apt install ansible
```

# Installation

## Clone the git repo:
```git clone git@github.com:mboilen/tgrgbox.git```

## Fill in config.yml files
Copy `ansible/config.template` to `ansible/config.yml` and fill in the information.

| Config Key | Value |
|------------|-------|
|auth_whitelist | A comma separated list of Discord user names (without discriminator) that are allowed to access the player|
|keygen_auth_whitelist | A comma separated list of Discord user names (without discriminator) that are allowed to access the streaming keys|
|discord_client_id | The client id from the Discord OAuth2 app|
|discord_secret_id | The client secret from the Discord OAuth2 app|
|tgrgbox_hostname| The base hostname for your tgrgbox instance (the player is at https://tgrgbox_hostname)|
|tgrgbox_dest_dir | The target directory for your tgrgbox instance.  Ansible will place all its files here |
|ome_secret_key| A random string that is used as the HMAC key to sign the Oven Media Engine security policies.  Avoid xml metacharacters in this string|
|letsencrypt_email| The email address that you'll use to get your certificates from LetsEncrypt|
|tgrgbace_tv_log| A path to a log file that will contain the streamer secrets for the player|

## Run ansible to generate your install

```
cd ansible
ansible-playbook tgrgbox.yml
```

## Run the docker stack
cd into the tgrgbox_dest_dir and run
```docker compose up -d``` 
(or `docker-compose` if you're on an older version of docker compose)

It will take a little while to start up on the first time as tgrgbox_nginx generates a Diffie-Helman key and gets certificates with certbot.  You can monitor progress with
```docker logs tgrgbox_nginx```

Once that's done you should be able to navigate to https://tgrgbox_hostname

## Test it out

Go to your hostname (i.e. https://flinch.tgrgbace.tv) and it should bring up the player page.  Go to /streamkey (i.e. https://flinch.tgrgbace.tv/streamkey) for the streaming keys.  Plug them into OBS and test it out.


# Appendix

## Port Forwarding
If you need to forward ports, forward
|Service        | Port           |
|---------------|----------------|
|http           | 80             |
|https          | 443            |
|rtmp           | 1935           |
|webrtc relay   | 3478           |
|srt            | 9999           |
|ICE candidates | 10000-10005/udp|

## Azure DNS
Rather than messing with Azure DNS, you can give you VM a host name.  Follow the steps in:

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/create-fqdn

To give your VM a hostname.  Then create an ALIAS record in your DNS provider that points to that name.  NGinx can then create the correct certificate

## Docker cheat sheet
```
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d --remove-orphans (add --force-recreate to force creation of containers so you don't have to worry about restarting containers)
docker system prune -a --volumes
```
